It is based<br> on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, Joe Russo, Anthony Russo, Fernando León González and Eric Skillman. <br>It is the sequel to Extraction, where Chris Hemsworth, Golshifteh Farahani and Adam Bessa reprise<br> their roles from the first film, while Tornike Gogrichiani, Tornike Bziava, Tinatin Dalakishvili, Daniel Bernhardt, Olga Kurylenko and Idris Elba appear in pivotal roles. In the film,<br> Tyler Rake is initially hired to rescue the family of an abusive crime lord from a prison in Georgia.</h3></p></li>
        <li><p><h3>TFollowing the successful debut of the first film, Netflix announced a sequel in May 2020 with Joe Russo returning to write,<br> Hargrave returning to direct and Hemsworth returning in the lead. By December, Joe and his brother Anthony<br> hoped that the sequel would develop the characters enough to start a cinematic universe. Filming was<br> scheduled to begin in Sydney in September 2021, but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and eventually started in Prague in November, before concluding in Vienna in April 2022. In addition <br>to the returns of the Russos, Hargrave and Hemsworth, Henry Jackman and Alex Belcher returned to compose the score.</h3></p></li>
